Create an app that allows a user to save tags for items in a single page list. 

An item can have a maximum of 5 tags and should be removable, but not editable. Each item in the list should display at least the name of the item and date. Tags should be persisted so that the tags remain across browser sessions. The list should also be filterable by user defined tags through a simple search. You must create the UI components yourself and avoid usage of third party libraries such as Material UI or Reactstrap, however you may use any additional open source libraries you need. You may use any icon set you wish to use. Please style your solution to match picture in the public folder.
