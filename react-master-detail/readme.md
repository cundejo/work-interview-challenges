Implement a Master Detail component that renders a list of items on the left and a detail view on the right. When the user clicks on a list item the render function of the detail view should be called with the corresponding payload. 

The component should provide the following API:

```jsx
  <MasterDetail
  payload={[
    { title: "Intro", content: "Hello Peers" },
    { title: "Welcome", content: "Welcome to Cool Company" },
  ]}
  />
```
